# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each mes-
# sage should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
# person’s name.

names = ["jack", "bob", "alex", "joe"]

print(f"Hello {names[0]}, how are you?")

print(f"Hello {names[2]}, how are you?")
print(f"Hello {names[3]}, how are you?")
