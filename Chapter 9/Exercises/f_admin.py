# 9-7. Admin: An administrator is a special kind of user. 
# 
# Write a class called Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 162)
# or Exercise 9-5 (page 167). 
# 
# Add an attribute, privileges, that stores a list of strings like "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on.
# 
# Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s set of
# privileges. Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.
