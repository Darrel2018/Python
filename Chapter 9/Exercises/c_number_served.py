# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). 
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. 
# Create an instance called restaurant from this class.  
# Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again. 
# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers that have been served. 
# Call this method with a new number and print the value again. 
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. 
# Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.
